# Quadrat-Analysis-for-GPH598

*Point pattern analysis*

## Introduction

Quadrat based tests are statistical methods for assessing whether the point process is random, clustered or dispersed. 
There are many versions of these tests and this component will focus on a subset of tests.

## Objectives
* allow for different sized grids (resolution)

* allow for different grid structures

  * squares
  * hexagons
* analytical inference

  * Chi-square test
* simulation based inference

  * *Monte Carlo testing*
  * CSR: uniform
  * CSR: possion
